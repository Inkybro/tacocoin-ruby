== tacocoin-ruby

Provides a Ruby library to the complete Tacocoin JSON-RPC API. 

== Installation

On Ruby 1.9, you can just install the gem and start using it. On 1.8, the 'json' gem is also required, so you'll need to install that first:

  gem install json

== Usage

As with most Ruby gems, you first need to require the library into your project:

  require 'tacocoin'

After doing this, the simplest possible usage looks like this:

  Tacocoin('username', 'password').balance
  # => 0.001

Or, if you prefer a somewhat more explicit representation, the following code performs the exact
same task:

  client = Tacocoin::Client.new('username', 'password')
  client.balance
  # => 0.001
  
The third and final way to use the library is by taking advantage of a simple DSL:

  include Tacocoin
  
  # set up credentials
  username 'username'
  password 'password'
  
  balance
  # => 0.001
  
  accounts
  # => {"account" => 0.001}
  
== Host, Port and SSL

Here are several examples of how you can change the host information:

  
  Tacocoin('username', 'password', :host => 'example.com', :port => 22555, :ssl => true)
  client = Tacocoin::Client.new('username', 'password', :host => 'example.com')
  client.port = 22555
  port 22555
  ssl?
  # => false
  ssl true
  ssl?
  # => true

You should see the Tacocoin::Client class documentation if you'd like to see the other options and methods
that are made available.


== Donations

If you found this library useful and feel inclined to compensate me for my trouble, I'm certainly not going to turn you down!
